- The about us page is responsive and its style is similar on screen sizes. As shown in the image below.

### Unfixed Bugs

- The only unfixed bug found is on screen size 320x480px for the gallery page where the header and footer only shows half and looks pushed to the right. This only affects the gallery page all the other pages header and footer at this size work. The reason for this was the fling minislide so that has been removed for screen sizes less than 400px as it was affecting the running of the page.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - Click on Pages under the code and Automation in the left panel
  - From the source section, select the Main Branch
