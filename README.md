## Solved bugs

- When I ran my code through the HTML W3C validator, I was given an error message on no closing tag on a div. This was fixed by adding the matching open tag.
- Another error i received when using the W3C CSS validator the fontawesome script. I was previously using a version with cdn url. The error was solved by creating a unique link from the fontawesome website and adding this script in the footer of all pages.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator] - <https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgfomengia.github.io%2Fdata-visualisation-pp1%2F>

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. From the github repository click on "settings" from the navigation bar.
2. Click on "pages" from navigation section on the left.
3. In the "source" section choose which branch you want to use from the dropdown menu, it will usually be the "main".
4. Select which folder you want to use, in most cases its the "/root".
5. Hit the "save" button, then wait for your site to be published.(This can take some time.)
6. When your site is ready and published the link will be above the "source" section
